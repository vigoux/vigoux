# Hey there !

I am Thomas, a CS student mainly interested in software security,
low-level programming, and programing language theory !

As a low-level enthusiast, I tend to like minimalistic tools, and I
happen to have a [Gopher hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)) open at `vigoux.giize.com`, so grab your
favorite gopher browser, and come to the dark side !
I happen to maintain some things on a self hosted git server too,
which is over at `vigoux.giize.com`.

# Wanna chat ?

I am almost always connected on [nvim-treesitter's
Zulip](nvim-treesitter.zulip-chat.com).

I am also a big fan of IRC, so I am both on `#vigoux-lair` on
Freenode, and Neovim's Gitter (through IRC too).

# Wanna help me a bit ?

First, thank you very much !

You can click on the little sponsor icon on the left, that'll help me
a lot !

Also, if you are a Brave user, you can sand me some `BAT`s (I am a
verified creator) !
